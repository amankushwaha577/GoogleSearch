# ``` GOOGLE SEARCH ```
I'm thrilled to present my latest project GoogleSearch, A Fully responsive Google clone single-page application using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and the Google Custom Search API. Leveraging advanced technologies, I utilized React.js for building the frontend, Tailwind CSS for elegant styling, and integrated the Google Custom Search API for real-time search results. This project showcased my proficiency in fundamental React.js concepts, including JSX, components, props, state management, lifecycle methods, conditional rendering, lists with keys, and the Context API.
